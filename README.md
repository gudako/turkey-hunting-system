# Turkey hunting system

A turkey hunting game based on wayrioutTOOMUCH windows forms. Ah, yes, it's a game.

This is *a 20-century-quality game using a 21-century-quality computer and frameworks*.


## The worst programming practice

First I want to say is this project is the

> **WORST** PROGRAMMING PRACTICE EVER IN THE WORLD

it's the history

I made it from 11/11/2017 all the way up an year, and the debug is finally done here.

But, I bet *everyone will SCCCCRRREEEAAAMMMM for the code is TOOOOOOOO kinda MESSY*

Bro do **not** learn from this coding style what the hack out of this

At least OOP... SHOULD be implemented okay? ***This project COMPLETELY procedure-oriented***


## What's the content of the sluppy game

You are assigned a mission to catch a specific turkey.

The turkey? Yes, but the turkey always runs and you

kinda go everywhere to fetch the turkey even to the ancient temple dude

___

The message in the game is to be the storyline of *Atropos* & *rooster* & *witch* 

Do you think modern love stories are romantic?

*well they are shit.*

___

Let's.. kinda turn back the topic.

What the hell of catching a *turkey*?

Such being the case the goal is to catch the *turkey*, why mind the *rooster* case?

Ohh, calm down. You know mate, the game is a ***non-logic***.

- *Okay... And this code will be archived.*
