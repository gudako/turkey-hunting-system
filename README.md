# Turkey hunting system

If you want to try out a new style of game then you may wanna play this.

Not so astonishing. But you will wonder why there is a fool who could create such a game in this sort of way.

I made it from 11/11/2017 all the way up an year, and the debug is finally done here.

Have got to say - Was a pure noob who started up with Visual Studio - purely because making a game seemed wonderful. Don't expect animations - I do not have the expense to hire an artist. Graphs are seized from the web - Don't have the expense to hire an artist.
